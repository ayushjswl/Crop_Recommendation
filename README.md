The Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers choose the best crops to grow based on different conditions and practical factors.
The system provides suggestions in four main parts:

Basic Crop Recommendation
Using inputs like soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH value, climatic conditions, soil type, and season, the system recommends the Top 5 most suitable crops for farming. The suggestions are personalized for each farmer based on their local conditions.

Crop Requirements
For every recommended crop, the system also shows its requirements, such as water needs, fertilizer and pesticide usage, and other important details. This helps farmers understand what resources are needed before making a decision.

Sowing and Harvesting Period
The system provides the ideal time for sowing and harvesting each crop. This helps farmers plan their schedule better and manage their land efficiently.

Future Market Demand and Prices
This feature predicts the future market demand and price trends for the recommended crops. It helps farmers compare which crops might be more profitable, giving them confidence that their hard work will be rewarded with good returns.

All these details are displayed together in a table format, so farmers can easily compare and select the best crop based on both agricultural and market factors.
